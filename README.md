# Smart Vision Technology for Quality Control

## **Project Overview**
This project leverages advanced computer vision and deep learning techniques to automate quality control in e-commerce by inspecting product images for identification, quantity, and quality testing. The system integrates machine learning models with real-time feedback loops to enhance productivity and accuracy in various quality control tasks.

## **Key Features**

1. **Product Identification and Classification**
   - Uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify products into predefined categories.
   - Achieves high accuracy by training on a labeled dataset of product images.

2. **Text Detection and Recognition**
   - Applies Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for extracting product information like labels and expiration dates.

3. **Defect Detection**
   - Detects product defects such as deformities, discoloration, and packaging errors.
   - Ensures consistent quality by flagging defective products.

4. **Real-Time Feedback and Integration**
   - Provides real-time feedback to operators or automated systems.
   - Integrates with existing inventory and data management systems.

## **Technologies Used**

### **Algorithms/Techniques**
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for product classification.
- **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)** for text extraction.
- **Object Detection** using YOLO/SSD techniques for identifying defects.
- **Feature Extraction** for analyzing product geometry, color, and texture.

### **Libraries/Frameworks**
- **TensorFlow/Keras** for building and training deep learning models.
- **OpenCV** for image preprocessing and analysis.
- **Scikit-Learn** for dataset splitting and evaluation.
- **NumPy & Pandas** for data manipulation.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for visualizing results.

### **Tools**
- **Flask** for creating a REST API to serve predictions.
- **AWS** for cloud deployment and scalability.
- **GitHub** for version control and collaboration.

## **Project Workflow**

1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**
   - Images are captured and normalized for consistent quality.
   - Filtering and segmentation techniques are applied to prepare data for model training.

2. **Model Training**
   - CNN models are trained on the preprocessed dataset.
   - The dataset is split into training and validation sets for performance evaluation.

3. **Feature Extraction & Analysis**
   - Key features such as edges, contours, and shapes are extracted for defect detection.

4. **Classification & Decision Making**
   - The trained model classifies products into categories.
   - A decision-making module compares results against a product database.

5. **Output & Feedback**
   - The system provides real-time feedback for defective or misclassified products.
   - Logs results for future analysis and continuous improvement.

## **Installation Instructions**

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/smart-vision-quality-control.git
   cd smart-vision-quality-control
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Prepare the dataset:
   - Organize product images into `train` and `validation` directories under `data/`.

5. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## **Usage**

1. Place product images in the specified input directory.
2. Run the application to classify the products and detect defects.
3. View the logs and real-time feedback in the terminal or output files.

## **Sample Results**
| Product Image  | Predicted Class | Defect Detected | Status        |
|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|---------------|
| Image_001.jpg  | Product A       | No              | Passed        |
| Image_002.jpg  | Product B       | Yes             | Flagged       |

## **Future Improvements**
- Expand the dataset to include more product categories.
- Enhance defect detection using advanced object detection models.
- Implement a web-based dashboard for monitoring results.
